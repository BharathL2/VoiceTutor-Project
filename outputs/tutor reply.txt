Query: Gradient Descent in Machine Learning

Explanation: 
Gradient descent is an optimization algorithm used to minimize the loss function in machine learning. 
It works by taking small steps in the direction of the steepest descent, which is the negative gradient. 
At each iteration, it updates the model's parameters to reduce error. Over time, these steps guide the model toward the optimal parameters.

Additional Information: 
This explanation clarifies how the model iteratively improves by adjusting parameters to minimize errors, making it foundational in many machine learning algorithms.
